# Part 1: Modeling N-ary Relationship Patterns
This project explores N-ary relationship modeling by identifying and analyzing real-world scenarios that require N-ary relations. The focus areas include urban planning, building construction, and language teaching, where complex interactions between multiple entities must be captured accurately.

### Urban Planning
#### 1. Public Transportation System Design
- **Example:** Spain's Madrid-Levante high-speed rail line connecting Madrid with Valencia, Alicante, and Murcia.
- **Classification:** Transportation System Development Pattern
- **Key Entities:** Country, rail line, cities, regions
- **Modeling Purpose:** Captures how the infrastructure enhances regional connectivity.

### Building Construction
#### 2. Stadium Renovation
- **Example:** Renovation of Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid, incorporating a retractable roof and 360-degree scoreboard.
- **Classification:** Renovation Pattern
- **Key Entities:** Stadium, new features, events
- **Modeling Purpose:** Demonstrates how renovations influence the usability of the structure for different types of events.

#### 3. Museum Construction
- **Example:** The Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, designed by Frank Gehry, boosting tourism and cultural value.
- **Classification:** Cultural Construction Pattern
- **Key Entities:** Architect, museum, exhibitions, tourism
- **Modeling Purpose:** Highlights the interconnection between architecture, cultural exhibitions, and urban impact.

### Language Teaching
#### 4. Language Proficiency Testing
- **Example:** TOEFL exam evaluating listening, speaking, reading, and writing skills.
- **Classification:** Language Assessment Pattern
- **Key Entities:** Test sections, scores, overall proficiency
- **Modeling Purpose:** Demonstrates how different test components contribute to an individual’s language proficiency level.

# Part 2: Urban Planning Ontology
To better represent knowledge structures in urban planning, an ontology was developed using various knowledge sources and established ontological standards.

### Knowledge Sources
Key Wikipedia pages were used for reference, including:
- Urban Planning
- Sustainable City
- Transit-oriented Development
- Mixed-use Development

### Ontology Reuse Strategy
The project integrates:
- **SOSA/SSN Ontology:** For representing organizational structures and urban monitoring.
- **GeoSPARQL:** For spatial data representation and GIS system integration.
- **Time Ontology:** For modeling temporal aspects in urban planning.

### Design and Implementation
- **Core Principles:** Modular structure with zones, facilities, and regulations for maintainability and extensibility.
- **Class Hierarchy:** Abstract, domain-specific, and implementation-level classes for detailed categorization.
- **Property Design:** Object and data properties capture relationships such as connectivity, temporal aspects, and administrative dependencies.
- **Environmental Considerations:** Integrated tracking for sustainability and impact assessments.

### Integration and Future Extensibility
- **External Compatibility:** Supports GIS integration, urban planning software, and municipal databases.
- **Scalability:** Designed to handle complex queries and large datasets with efficient property chains.
- **Future Enhancements:** Expansion to smart city concepts, additional sustainability metrics, and accessibility measures.
